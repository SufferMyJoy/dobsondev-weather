# Description

Adds the Weather to your site. The weather app is available as both a widget and a shortcode. If you have any problems or questions please email me at [alex@dobsondev.com](mailto:alex@dobsondev.com). Please download from the [Official WordPress Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dobsondev-weather/).

## Widget

To get the Widget working, simply go to Appearance -> Widgets and drag the "DobsonDev Weather Widget" to where ever you want it to display. Inside the widget you simply need to fill out the City/Town you want the weather for. The City/Town should be in the format of Town or City, comma, then the country code. For example, New York would be location="New York, US". Click save and the widget will then display the weather on the front end of the site.

## Shortcode

[weather location="City/Town, CC" align="align"]

This Shortcode will embed the weather app into your page. Be sure to replace the above code with information pertaining to you. The location should be in the format of Town or City, comma, then the country code. For example, New York would be location="New York, US". The alignment is where you want the shortcode to be aligned to. This works the same way as the WordPress image alignments, so your choices are "right", "left", or "center".
